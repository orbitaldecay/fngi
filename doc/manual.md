<h1>The fngi programmer&#x27;s manual</h1>
<h2>Document conventions</h2>
Words and phrases with special meaning are 
<i>italicisized</i>
 the first time they are used. Fragments of source code are always 
<code>monospaced</code>
.<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Fngi is a stack-based language. The semantics of fngi are described in terms of stack manipulation. <p>
<h2>Tokens</h2>
The smallest syntactic unit of a fngi program is a 
<i>token</i>
. That is, a fngi program is composed of one or more tokens. Tokens are evaluated from left to right and from top to bottom. Whitespace is sometimes used to delineate between tokens, but has no semantic value.<p>
<h2>Value tokens</h2>
A 
<i>value token</i>
 is a kind of token. When a value token is evaluated, the number represented by the value token is pushed onto the 
<i>working stack</i>
.<p>
<code>1</code>
<p>is a value token. When evaluated, it pushes the number 1 onto the working stack.<p>
<code>1 2</code>
<p>is a fngi program. It consists of two value tokens: 
<code>1</code>
 and 
<code>2</code>
. When this program is evaluated, the number 1 is pushed onto the working stack, then the number 2 is pushed onto the working stack. Value tokens can also be written in hexadecimal.<p>
<code>0x10</code>
<p>is a value token. When 
<code>0x10</code>
 is evaluated, the number 16 is pushed onto the working stack.<p>
<h2>Function tokens</h2>
A 
<i>function token</i>
 is a kind of token. Function tokens in fngi are evaluated differently than functions in many other stack-based languages. Rather than being evaluated immediately, function token evaluation is defered until after the next token is evaluated.<p>The token 
<code>+</code>
 is a function token. When 
<code>+</code>
 is evaluated, two numbers are popped from the working stack, then their sum is pushed to the working stack. The program 
<code>1 + 2</code>
 performs the following operations in order:<p>
<ol><li value="1">Push the number 1 onto the working stack.</li><li value="2">Push the number 2 onto the working stack (the evaluation of <code>+</code> is deferred).</li><li value="3">Finally, evaluate <code>+</code>.</li></ol>
When this is performed, the number 3 is left on the working stack. Notice how this allows functions of arity 2 to be written in infix notation.<p>The token 
<code>*</code>
 is a function token. When 
<code>*</code>
 is evaluated, two numbers are popped from the working stack, then their product is pushed to the working stack. The program 
<code>1 + 2 * 4</code>
 performs the following operations in order:<p>
<ol><li value="1">Push the number 1 onto the working stack.</li><li value="2">Push the number 2 onto the working stack (<code>+</code> is deferred).</li><li value="3">Evaluate <code>+</code> leaving the number 3 on the working stack.</li><li value="4">Push the number 4 onto the working stack (<code>*</code> is deferred).</li><li value="5">Evaluate <code>*</code> leaving the number 12 on the working stack.</li></ol>
When multiple functions are deferred successively, they are evaluated from last deferred to first deferred. The program 
<code>1 2 + * 4</code>
 (a program which you would probably not want to write) performs the following operations in order:<p>
<ol><li value="1">Push the number 1 onto the working stack.</li><li value="2">Push the number 2 onto the working stack.</li><li value="3">Push the number 4 onto the working stack (<code>+</code> is deferred, then <code>*</code> is deferred).</li><li value="4">Evaluate <code>*</code>, leaving the number 8 on top of the working stack.</li><li value="5">Evaluate <code>+</code>, leaving the number 9 on top of the working stack.</li></ol>
<h2>Syntactic tokens</h2>
A 
<i>syntactic function token</i>
 or 
<i>syn token</i>
 is a kind of token. Syn tokens are extremely powerul. They are similar to macros in other languages.<p>
<h2>TODO</h2>
This is a TODO list for this document.<p>
<ol><li value="1">Explain <code>()</code>, <code>+(1 2)</code> and <code>1 2 +()</code> in the syntactic tokens section.</li><li value="2">Correct grammar and spelling mistakes using automated checker.</li></ol>
