The <span>	global delay queue		</span> is the <span>		delay queue			</span> to which <span>			tokens				</span> are <span>			<i>usually</i>			</span> added. To <span>			execute				</span> a <span>		delay queue			</span> is to <span>			execute				</span> the <span>			tokens				</span> in that <span>		delay queue			</span> in the order in which they were added. The <span>	global delay queue		</span> is <span>		executed			</span> after all <span>			tokens				</span> have been <span>		evaluated			</span>.</p><p></p><p>When <span>			tokens				</span> are <span>		evaluated			</span>, <span>		execution			</span> is <span>			<i>usually</i>			</span> delayed. A deeper level of detail to our explanation of the behavior of the <span>		fngi program			</span> <span>		<code>1 2</code>			</span> would be:</p><p><ol><li value="1">The <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>1</code>				</span> is <span>		evaluated			</span>. It undergoes <span>			delayed				</span> <span>		execution			</span> and is added to the <span>	global delay queue		</span>.</li><li value="2">The <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>2</code>				</span> is <span>		evaluated			</span>. It undergoes <span>			delayed				</span> <span>		execution			</span> and is added to the <span>	global delay queue		</span>.</li><li value="3">Now that all <span>			tokens				</span> have been <span>		evaluated			</span>, we dequeue the <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>1</code>				</span> from the <span>	global delay queue		</span>. The <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>1</code>				</span> is <span>		executed			</span>, and the <span>			number				</span> 1 is pushed to the <span>		working stack			</span>.</li><li value="4">We dequeue the <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>2</code>				</span> from the <span>	global delay queue		</span>. The token <span>		<code>2</code>				</span> is <span>		executed			</span>, and the <span>			number				</span> 2 is pushed to the <span>		working stack			</span>.</li></ol>To <span>			execute				</span> a <span>			token				</span> <span>		immediately			</span>, the <span>		<code>imm#</code>			</span> <span>			token				</span> is prepended to that <span>			token				</span>. The <span>		<code>imm#</code>			</span> <span>			token				</span> is <span>			<i>always</i>			</span> <span>		executed			</span> <span>		immediately			</span>. For example, when the <span>		fngi program			</span> <span>	<code>2 imm#3 4</code>			</span> is <span>		executed			</span>, the following operations occur in order:</p><p><ol><li value="1">The <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>2</code>				</span> is <span>		evaluated			</span>. It undergoes <span>			delayed				</span> <span>		execution			</span> and is added to the <span>	global delay queue		</span>.</li><li value="2">The <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>imm#</code>			</span> is <span>		executed			</span> <span>		immediately			</span>. It causes the <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>3</code>				</span> to be <span>		executed			</span> <span>		immediately			</span>. Prior to <span>			parsing				</span> the <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>4</code>				</span>, the <span>			number				</span> 3 is pushed to the <span>		working stack			</span>.</li><li value="3">The <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>4</code>				</span> is <span>		evaluated			</span>.

The general purpose of <span>		syntactic tokens		</span> is to implement syntactic constructs. We have already seen an example of one <span>		syntactic token			</span>: the <span>		<code>imm#</code>			</span> <span>			token				</span>. The <span>		<code>imm#</code>			</span> <span>			token				</span> triggers <span>		immediate			</span> <span>		execution			</span> of the <span>			token				</span> which follows it.</p><p>The <span>			token				</span> <span>	<code>(</code>				</span> is a <span>		syntactic token			</span>. When the <span>			token				</span> <span>	<code>(</code>				</span> is <span>		executed			</span>, it <span>		evaluates			</span> all subsequent <span>			tokens				</span> until it encounters the <span>			token				</span> <span>	<code>)</code>				</span>. In effect, this causes all sequences of <span>			tokens				</span> which are parenthesized to be treated as a single <span>			token				</span> in a number of contexts.</p><p>For example, consider the <span>		fngi program			</span> <span>	<code>5 imm#(1 + 2)</code>		</span>. The <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>5</code>				</span> undergoes <span>			delayed				</span> <span>		execution			</span>. The <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>imm#</code>			</span> causes the token <span>	<code>(</code>				</span> to be <span>		executed			</span> <span>		immediately			</span>. The <span>			token				</span> <span>	<code>(</code>				</span> <span>		evaluates			</span> <span>	<code>1 + 2</code>			</span> (stopping at <span>	<code>)</code>				</span>) and triggers their <span>		immediate			</span> <span>		execution			</span> as well. The result is that the <span>			number				</span> 3 is pushed to the <span>		working stack			</span>, then the <span>			number				</span> 5 is pushed to the <span>		working stack			</span>.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></div>
