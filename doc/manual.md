Otherwise, we say the <span>		execution			</span> of the <span>			token				</span> was <span>			delayed				</span>.

The general purpose of <span>		syntactic tokens		</span> is to implement syntactic constructs. We have already seen an example of one <span>		syntactic token			</span>: the <span>		<code>imm#</code>			</span> <span>			token				</span>. The <span>		<code>imm#</code>			</span> <span>			token				</span> triggers <span>		immediate			</span> <span>		execution			</span> of the <span>			token				</span> which follows it.</p><p>The <span>			token				</span> <span>	<code>(</code>				</span> is a <span>		syntactic token			</span>. When the <span>			token				</span> <span>	<code>(</code>				</span> is <span>		executed			</span>, it <span>		evaluates			</span> all subsequent <span>			tokens				</span> until it encounters the <span>			token				</span> <span>	<code>)</code>				</span>. In effect, this causes all sequences of <span>			tokens				</span> which are parenthesized to be treated as a single <span>			token				</span> in a number of contexts.</p><p>For example, consider the <span>		fngi program			</span> <span>	<code>5 imm#(1 + 2)</code>		</span>. The <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>5</code>				</span> undergoes <span>			delayed				</span> <span>		execution			</span>. The <span>			token				</span> <span>		<code>imm#</code>			</span> causes the token <span>	<code>(</code>				</span> to be <span>		executed			</span> <span>		immediately			</span>. The <span>			token				</span> <span>	<code>(</code>				</span> <span>		evaluates			</span> <span>	<code>1 + 2</code>			</span> (stopping at <span>	<code>)</code>				</span>) and triggers their <span>		immediate			</span> <span>		execution			</span> as well. The result is that the <span>			number				</span> 3 is pushed to the <span>		working stack			</span>, then the <span>			number				</span> 5 is pushed to the <span>		working stack			</span>.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></div>
